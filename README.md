# rBBS
R package to import USGS' BBS data

This started as some files for use in a project, but other people might find them useful.

## To Do

- write code to import migrant/non-breeder data
- write code to import noise data
- check route & weather data are useable in their own right
- add capability to include sites which are surveyed but a species in not observed
- document SpCodes
- sort out non-ASCII characters
Once that's done, improve functionality, stability etc.
